# YouTube Trending Video Analytics – End-to-End BI & AI Data Engineering Solution

## 📌 Project Description  
This project is an end-to-end **on-premise Data Engineering pipeline** built using Microsoft technologies. It uses the **YouTube Trending Video Dataset** from Kaggle, focusing on data from **Canada, the United States, and Brazil**.  

The goal is to build a **data warehouse architecture** that ingests raw files, transforms and integrates them, and finally delivers insights through an **interactive Power BI dashboard** and an **Intelligent AI Agent**.  
This project was completed as part of my training in **Global Brand Solutions Academy**.  

## 🔎 Project Overview  
1. **Getting the Data (SSIS)** → Extracted CSV files for (Canada, US, and Brazil).  
2. **ODS Layer (SSIS)** → Loaded raw data into the ODS as the initial layer.  
3. **STG Layer (SSIS)** → Performed cleansing, data conversion, and standardization.  
4. **DWH Layer (SSIS)** → Built star schema, added surrogate keys, and created lookups between Fact & Dimensions.  
5. **Semantic Model (SSAS)** → Created relationships and DAX measures for KPIs (views, likes, dislikes, comments).  
6. **Dashboard (Power BI)** → Designed interactive visuals to analyze trends, regional comparisons, and channel performance.
7. **AI Agent (LangChain/Groq)** → Implemented a RAG-based Large Language Model to allow natural language querying of the database and documentation.


## 🗂 Data Extraction Challenges  

While extracting the dataset into **SSIS**, we faced an issue with the **Connection Manager**. Some columns were incorrectly detected as **object** instead of their actual data type.  

🔎 After analyzing the problem, we found that the **`title`** column contained text values with embedded commas. These commas confused the CSV parser, causing SSIS to misinterpret column structures.  

✅ **Solution:** We used **Python preprocessing** to fix the issue before loading into SSIS. Specifically, we added quotes (`""`) around any text field containing at least one comma. This ensured that SSIS correctly treated the values as a single column.

## 🔹 Step 1: Getting the Data & Creating the ODS Layer  

After fixing the **title column issue**, we successfully created the **Connection Manager** for the CSV files. Using the advanced options in the CSV connection manager, we defined the most suitable data types for each column based on the dataset description.  

Next, we created a new database called **`YoutubeODS`** with a table named **`Videos`** using a SQL script.  

👉 Check the script here: [![Open Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-Script-blue?logo=databricks)](SQL%20Queries/ODS_Creation.sql)  

After preparing the dataset, the CSV files for **Canada, US, and Brazil** were added into the **Data Flow** in the package called **ODS**. The files were then **unioned** and loaded into the **`YoutubeODS.Videos`** table as the destination.

</p>  

## 🔹 Step 2: Creating the STG Layer  

After loading the data into the **`YoutubeODS.Videos`** table, the next step was to design the **STG database structure** to prepare the data for the Data Warehouse.  

We started by creating both a **Logical Model** and a **Conceptual Model** to define the dimensions and fact table.

  <img src="Data Models/Conceptual model.png" alt="Conceptual Model" width="400"/>  
</p>  

Based on these models, we created a new database called **`YoutubeSTG`**. This database contains the **Dimension** and **Fact** tables as defined by the modeling step.  

👉 Check the SQL script here: [![Open Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-Script-blue?logo=databricks)](SQL%20Queries/DimsFactCreation.sql)  

After creating the structure, we filled the **Dimensions** and **Fact** tables in the STG database using SSIS, as shown below:  

<p align="center">  
  <img src="Full Flow ScreenShots/1) ETL Pipeline/STG Full View.png" alt="STG Data Flow" width="500"/>  
</p>  

## 🔹 Step 3: Creating the DWH Layer  

After finalizing the **Dimensions** and **Fact** structure in the STG layer, the next step was to build the **Data Warehouse (DWH)**.  

We created a new database called **`YoutubeDWH`** containing all the **Dimension** and **Fact** tables, ready to host the data.  

👉 Check the SQL script here: [![Open Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-Script-blue?logo=databricks)](SQL%20Queries/DWH_Creation.sql)  

Once the schema was in place, we transferred the data from the **STG dimensions** into the **DWH dimensions**.  
Using SSIS, we performed **lookups** between the Fact and Dimensions so the Fact table could reference the correct **surrogate keys** (IDs).

  <img src="Full Flow ScreenShots/1) ETL Pipeline/DWH Fact Lookup.png" alt="DWH Lookup" width="400"/>  
</p>  

## 🔹 Step 4: Building the Semantic Model (SSAS)  

After creating the **DWH**, we loaded the **Fact** and **Dimension** tables into an **SSAS Tabular Project** to build the **Semantic Model**.  
This step involved:  
- Creating **DAX measures** (e.g., total views, likes, dislikes, engagement).  
- Defining **relationships** between Fact and Dimensions.  

<p align="center">  
  <img src="Full Flow ScreenShots/2) Semantic Model (SSAS)/Semantic Layer Model View.png" alt="SSAS Semantic Model View" width="500"/>  
</p>  

Once the measures and relationships were defined, the final **Semantic Model** was deployed to SSAS.  
This allowed the model to be cached and updated for efficient querying and analysis.

</p>  

## 🔹 Step 5: Power BI Interactive Dashboard  

Finally, we connected **Power BI** to the deployed **SSAS Semantic Model** to build an interactive dashboard.  
The dashboard was designed with **two pages**, providing insights into:  
- Video performance metrics (views, likes, dislikes, comments).  
- Regional comparisons between **Canada, US, and Brazil**.  
- Trending patterns and engagement rates.

# 🤖 Phase 2: Intelligent RAG Agent  

To enhance the accessibility of the analytics, we developed an **AI-powered Agent** using **LangChain** and **Groq**. This agent allows users to interact with the data using natural language, abstracting the complexities of SQL and DAX.  

### 🧠 Architecture & Logic  

The agent operates using a "Router" architecture that classifies user intent into three categories:  

1.  **Documentation (RAG)**: Answers conceptual questions (e.g., "How was the STG layer built?") by retrieving context from project documentation (PDFs) stored in a **FAISS** vector database.  
2.  **Data Warehouse (SQL)**: Generates and executes T-SQL queries against the `YoutubeDWH` database for raw data extraction. It includes schema-aware prompt engineering to ensure correct joins and `BIGINT` casting.  
3.  **Semantic Model (DAX)**: Generates and executes DAX queries against the `YoutubeAnalysis` SSAS model. It first checks the vector database for *existing* measures before generating new DAX formulas on the fly.  

### 🚀 Key Features  

* **Smart Intent Detection:** Automatically decides whether to query the PDF docs, the SQL Database, or the SSAS Cube.  
* **Query Normalization:** Uses an LLM to correct country names (e.g., converting "USA" to "United States of America") before querying the database.  
* **Dynamic Schema Loading:** The agent retrieves the current database schema from the vector store to write accurate queries.  
* **Streamlit Interface:** Provides a user-friendly chat interface for real-time interaction.  

### 🛠 Agent Tech Stack  
* **Orchestration:** LangChain  
* **LLM:** Groq (openai/gpt-oss-120b)  
* **Vector Store:** FAISS (using HuggingFace Embeddings)  
* **Database Drivers:** `SQLAlchemy` (SQL) and `adodbapi` (SSAS/DAX)
